Don And Mimi Galvin Seemed To Be Living The American Dream. After World War Ii, Don's Work With The Air Force Brought Them To Colorado, Where Their Twelve Children Perfectly Spanned The Baby Boom: The Oldest Born In 1945, The Youngest In 1965. In Those Years, There Was An Established Script For A Family Like The Galvins--aspiration, Hard Work, Upward Mobility, Domestic Harmony--and They Worked Hard To Play Their Parts. But Behind The Scenes Was A Different Story: Psychological Breakdown, Sudden Shocking Violence, Hidden Abuse. By The Mid-1970s, Six Of The Ten Galvin Boys, One After The Other, Were Diagnosed As Schizophrenic. How Could All This Happen To One Family? What Took Place Inside The House On Hidden Valley Road Was So Extraordinary That The Galvins Became One Of The First Families To Be Studied By The National Institutes Of Mental Health. Their Story Offers A Shadow History Of The Science Of Schizophrenia, From The Era Of Institutionalization, Lobotomy, And The Schizophrenogenic Mother, To The Search For Genetic Markers For The Disease, Always Amidst Profound Disagreements About The Nature Of The Illness Itself. And Unbeknownst To The Galvins, Samples Of Their Dna Informed Decades Of Genetic Research That Continues Today, Offering Paths To Treatment, Prediction, And Even Eradication Of The Disease For Future Generations. With Clarity And Compassion, Bestselling And Award-winning Author Robert Kolker Uncovers One Family's Unforgettable Legacy Of Suffering, Love And Hope.&title=Hidden Valley Road: Inside the Mind of an American Family&status=publish&excerpt=The Heartrending Story Of A Midcentury American Family With Twelve Children, Six Of Them Diagnosed W&featured_media=1306\n",

It’s A Given That A Deep, Fulfilling Friendship Is A Key To Happiness—everyone From Greek Philosophers To Instagram Influencers Will Tell You That! But For All The Rosy Sentiments Surrounding Friendship, We Don’t Talk Much About What It Really Takes To Stay Close Friends For The Long Haul. Now Two Friends, The Popular Podcast Cohosts Aminatou Sow And Ann Friedman, Elaborate On Their Equally Messy And Life-affirming Big Friendship In This Honest And Hilarious Book That Chronicles Their First Ten Years In One Another’s Lives. Aminatou And Ann Define Big Friendship As A Strong, Significant Bond That Transcends Life Phases, Geographical Locations, And Emotional Shifts. And They Should Know: The Two Have Had Moments Of Charmed Bliss And Deep Frustration, Of Profound Connection And Gut-wrenching Alienation. They’ve Been, At Various Points, Inseparable Companions, Long-distance Support Providers, Work Wives, Estranged Relatives, Next-of-kin, And Everything In Between. They Have Weathered Life-threatening Health Scares, Getting Fired From Their Dream Jobs, And One Unfortunate Thanksgiving Dinner Eaten In A Car In A Parking Lot In Rancho Cucamonga. And They Both Agree: The Most Important Part Of A Big Friendship Is Making The Reciprocal, Firm Decision To Invest In One Another The Way You Would Invest In Yourself.

R. Eric Thomas Didn't Know He Was Different Until The World Told Him So. Everywhere He Went--whether It Was His Rich, Mostly White, Suburban High School, His Conservative Black Church, Or His Ivy League College In A Big City--he Found Himself On The Outside Looking In. In Essays By Turns Hysterical And Heartfelt, Eric Redefines What It Means To Be An Other Through The Lens Of His Own Life Experience. He Explores The Two Worlds Of His Childhood: The Barren Urban Landscape Where His Parents' House Was An Anomalous Bright Spot, And The Verdant School They Sent Him To In White Suburbia. He Writes About Struggling To Reconcile His Christian Identity With His Sexuality, About The Exhaustion Of Code-switching In College, Accidentally Getting Famous On The Internet (for The Wrong Reason), And The Surreal Experience Of Covering The 2016 Election As Well As The Seismic Change That Came Thereafter. Ultimately, Eric Seeks The Answer To The Ever More Relevant Question: Is The Future Worth It? Why Do We Bother When Everything Seems To Be Getting Worse? As The World Continues To Shift In Unpredictable Ways, Eric Finds The Answers To These Questions By Re-envisioning What Normal Means, And In The Powerful Alchemy That Occurs When You At Last Place Yourself At The Center Of Your Own Story. For Fans Of Samantha Irby, Michael Arcenaux, And David Sedaris, Here For It Will Resonate Deeply And Joyfully With Everyone Who Has Ever Felt Pushed To The Margins, Struggled With Self-acceptance, Or Wished To Shine More Brightly In A Dark World. Stay Here For It--the Future May Surprise You.&title=Here for It: Or, How to Save Your Soul in America; Essays&status=publish&excerpt=From The Creator Of Elle's Eric Reads The News, A Poignant And Hilarious Memoir-in-essays About Grow&featured_media=1318\n",

You Have To Remember, He Reminded Me, That Harvard Is Older Than The U.s. Government. You Have To Remember Because Harvard Doesn't Let You Forget.1969: The Height Of Counterculture And The Year Universities Would Seek To Curb The Unruly Spectacle Of Student Protest; The Winter That Harvard University Would Begin The Tumultuous Process Of Merging With Radcliffe, Its All-female Sister School; And The Year That Jane Britton, An Ambitious 23-year-old Graduate Student In Harvard's Anthropology Department And Daughter Of Radcliffe Vice President Boyd Britton, Would Be Found Bludgeoned To Death In Her Cambridge, Massachusetts Apartment. Forty Years Later, Becky Cooper A Curious Undergrad, Will Hear The First Whispers Of The Story. In The First Telling The Body Was Nameless. The Story Was This: A Harvard Student Had Had An Affair With Her Professor, And The Professor Had Murdered Her In The Peabody Museum Of Archaeology And Ethnology Because She'd Threatened To Talk About The Affair. The Professor Still Taught At The University. On The Next Telling A Story Begins To Unfold, One That Cooper Will Follow For 10 Years, One Of Gender Inequality In Academia, A 'cowboy Culture' Among Empowered Male Elites, The Silencing Effect Of Institutions, And Our Compulsion To Rewrite The Stories Of Female Victims. Though The Rumor Prove False, The Story That Unfolds, One That Cooper Will Follow For Ten Years, Is Even More Complex: A Tale Of Gender Inequality In Academia, A 'cowboy Culture' Among Empowered Male Elites, The Silencing Effect Of Institutions, And Our Compulsion To Rewrite The Stories Of Female Victims. We Keep The Dead Close Is A Memoir Of Mirrors, Misogyny, And Murder. It Is At Once A Rumination On The Violence And Oppression That Rules Our Revered Institutions, A Ghost Story Reflecting One Young Woman's Past Onto Another's Present, And A Love Story For A Girl Who Was Lost To History.\", 'language': 'en_US', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/37/9781538746837.jpg', 'title_long': 'We Keep the Dead Close: A Murder at Harvard and a Half Century of Silence', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.55 Inches, Weight: 1.62 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches', 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '2020-11-10T00:00:01Z', 'authors': ['Cooper, Becky'], 'title': 'We Keep the Dead Close: A Murder at Harvard and a Half Century of Silence', 'isbn13': '9781538746837', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '1538746840'}, 'publish_date': '2020-11-10T00:00:01Z', 'isbn': '1538746832'}}\n",

First, she was taken from her family, and now it won’t be long before she’s taken by the tide… Kara Dawkins is missing. One minute she was sitting on a park bench, her coat wrapped around her against the biting cold. The next minute, she was gone. Her mother is beside herself with worry. Kara’s messy, poster-covered bedroom feels so empty without her lying across her bed with her headphones on, her feet tapping to the beat. Did she run away, or was she snatched? Does anyone know she’s been sneaking out at night, or about the secret hidden inside her jewellery box? But then another girl’s body washes up on the beach a few days later, in the exact spot where the last trace of Detective Charlie Winters’ missing sister was found years ago. It can’t be a coincidence, not in a town as small as this. By taking Kara, someone is re-opening the wounds of the past and setting a deadly trap. And unless Charlie steps forward to take the bait, many more innocent victims will follow… An absolutely unputdownable crime thriller that will leave you gasping for breath.

First, she was taken from her family, and now it won’t be long before she’s taken by the tide… Kara Dawkins is missing. One minute she was sitting on a park bench, her coat wrapped around her against the biting cold. The next minute, she was gone. Her mother is beside herself with worry. Kara’s messy, poster-covered bedroom feels so empty without her lying across her bed with her headphones on, her feet tapping to the beat. Did she run away, or was she snatched? Does anyone know she’s been sneaking out at night, or about the secret hidden inside her jewellery box? But then another girl’s body washes up on the beach a few days later, in the exact spot where the last trace of Detective Charlie Winters’ missing sister was found years ago. It can’t be a coincidence, not in a town as small as this. By taking Kara, someone is re-opening the wounds of the past and setting a deadly trap. And unless Charlie steps forward to take the bait, many more innocent victims will follow… An absolutely unputdownable crime thriller that will leave you gasping for breath. Fans of Angela Marsons, Robert Dugoni and Lisa Regan will need to sleep with the lights on!
